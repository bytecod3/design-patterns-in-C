ADT stands for Abstract Data Type and it is basically a set of values and operations on these values. The ADT is considered first-class if we can have many, unique instances of it.  

This pattern decouples the interface from implementation, 

Deals with data encapsulation.

Encapsulation entails getting two views of a design: external behavior and the internal details.

The ADT pattern is useful e.g for different development teams, allowing one of them to publish interfaces while hiding implementation details.
